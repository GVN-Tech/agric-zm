const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const { createCanvas } = require('canvas');

// If canvas is not available (likely in this environment), we will use a simpler approach
// creating base64 images or just copying a placeholder if possible.
// However, since I cannot install packages, I will generate an HTML file that generates the images
// and saves them, OR I will create a simple SVG based icon system since I can write text files.
// But manifest expects PNGs. 

// Alternative: Create a simple HTML file that the user can open to generate icons, 
// OR simpler: Create SVGs and save them as .svg, then update manifest to use SVGs? 
// No, PWA best practice is PNG.

// Let's try to create a python script to generate PNGs since python is available in terminal 4.
// Python has PIL/Pillow usually. Let's check.
